# Problem statement
Build an application to maintain a to-do list with parameters like the title of the task, some descriptive text with due date(and/or time of reminder). The app must send reminders via notification for the tasks with a specified due date/time. It must also keep track of completed and overdue tasks as well (optionally provide a setting to send reminders for overdue tasks).
